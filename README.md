# Telemetry-System developed by UHEV

This system allows to measure the performance of an electric prototype vehicle. It was specially designed to test and tune the performance of a battery-electric supermilleage vehicle. 

The system allows to measure four variables: Current, Voltage, Wheel-RPM and Motor-RPM.

It is currently under development and the software is not fully finished, but it should do his work.
